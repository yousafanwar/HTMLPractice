            // This loop will be responsible for lines. Because we are going to print stars on 10 lines, so loop for 10 lines.
            for (let stars = 1; stars <= line; stars++) {
                // And this inner loop (or nested loop) will be responsible for printing astersiks (*) in a way that first line will have only one asterisk,
                // second will have 2 and third will have 3 and so on. That is why stars variable initial value has been set to 1 and will go upto the 
                // the value of what line variable currently holds.
                asterisks += '*' // Add one asterisk (*) to the variable asterisks
            }
            console.log(asterisks); // As we added asterisks to this variable now lets print it on console.
            asterisks = '';         // Now we are going to move to the next line so let's reset the asterisks value to empty string.
